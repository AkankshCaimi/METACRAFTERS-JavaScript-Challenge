# Final Project of JavaScript Course

## Description
This is the final project of JavaScript Course. In this project a NFT has been implemented using JavaScript.

## Tasks Completed
The following tasks have been implemented in this challenge:

   1. Create a variable that can hold a number of NFT's. What type of variable might this be?
   2. Create an object inside your mintNFT function that will hold the metadata for your NFTs. 
      The metadata values will be passed to the function as parameters. When the NFT is ready, 
      you will store it in the variable you created in step 1
   3. Your listNFTs() function will print all of your NFTs metadata to the console (i.e. console.log("Name: " + someNFT.name))
   4. For good measure, getTotalSupply() should return the number of NFT's you have created.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, follow the instructions below:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Remix IDE and create a new file.
3. Copy and paste the code of the smart contract into the file.
4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the smart contract on a local blockchain or on a testnet.
6. Test the smart contract by interacting with it using Remix IDE or other compatible tools.
